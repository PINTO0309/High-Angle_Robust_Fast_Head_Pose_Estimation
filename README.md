# HFHPE: High-Angle Robust Fast Head Pose Estimation

![GitHub](./assets/mit.svg) [![DOI](./assets/zenodo.23252206.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23252205) [![Ask DeepWiki](./assets/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/PINTO0309/High-Angle_Robust_Fast_Head_Pose_Estimation)

A training, distillation and ONNX deployment pipeline for **one-pass yaw / pitch / roll head-pose estimation that stays robust at extreme head poses and under heavy occlusion while remaining light enough for CPU inference**.

- **Head pose on whole-head crops.** HFHPE runs on head boxes produced by an object detector. The whole head is localized stably regardless of its orientation, so the pipeline keeps estimating through profiles, strong back-tilt, the back of the head, and heavy occlusion.
- **Full-surround output.** Yaw covers the full 0–360° circle (including the back of the head), pitch covers −120…+120° (beyond +90° = back-tilt), and roll covers the full 360° of in-plane rotation. Every angle is regressed as a biternion (unit `cos/sin`) with a von Mises concentration κ as a per-angle confidence.
- **One-pass integrated graph.** A tiny roll branch estimates the in-plane rotation, the crop is derotated inside the ONNX graph (GridSample), and the yaw/pitch body then runs on the upright crop — one input, one run, six trigonometric outputs plus three confidences.
- The teacher is a DINOv3 ViT-L/16 (320×320); the students are a ViT-T/16, a PP-HGNetV2-B0 based CNN and a from-scratch MBConv CNN (all 64×64 input). Students are trained by online distillation from the teacher and exported to verified ONNX graphs.
- Training data for yaw/pitch is **synthetic by gpt-image-2, plus 618 of the author's own self-portraits** (the SynthYawPitchPose dataset: 51,194 synthetic whole-head crops, 18.7k of them with large accessories such as masks, sunglasses and hats, every label reviewed by eye and 34.8k of them corrected by hand; plus 618 self-portrait crops, source `synthetic_real_001`, labeled with the teacher's pseudo-labels and corrected by hand where needed); the roll branch additionally adapts to real photographs whose roll ground truth is generated mechanically by rotation — no external pose label is ever used as a training target.
- **Roll is decoupled from yaw/pitch, by design.** Synthesizing a head at a prescribed yaw and pitch while keeping the composition intact is not difficult once the right generation conditions are met, but roll is hard to express, and a roll twist skews the directions along which yaw and pitch are estimated. Only yaw and pitch are therefore prescribed strictly: every yaw/pitch image is generated upright (roll assumed to be 0°), and roll is learned on its own from upright crops rotated in-plane by a known angle, which makes the roll ground truth exact.
- **Occlusion diversity is generated, not only erased.** On top of the strictly prescribed yaw and pitch, the dataset emphasizes the diversity of head occlusion by accessories that are likely to occur in the real world. It contains a large number of pose–accessory combinations that hardly exist in public datasets, so that occlusion robustness does not rest solely on simplistic, unrealistic preprocessing such as Random Erasing or Cutout.

> [!NOTE]
> Approximately 24 ms of the inference time is spent on object detection by DEIMv2. The head detection model does not need to be DEIMv2; a lightweight object detection model such as YOLO is sufficient.

## 1. Results at a glance

Validation MAAE (mean absolute angular error, degrees, lower is better) of the current generation (all four bodies retrained). Params and GMACs are counted on the exported ONNX graphs (`scripts/count_macs_onnx.py`; GFLOPs = 2 × GMACs). CPU ms = average latency of the batch-1 graph on an i9-10900K with onnxruntime 1.22 CPU EP, measured with [sit4onnx](https://github.com/PINTO0309/sit4onnx).

The weights and ONNX/TFLite files can be downloaded from the [weights](https://github.com/PINTO0309/High-Angle_Robust_Fast_Head_Pose_Estimation/releases/tag/weights) tag in the releases.

This is a benchmark based on the SynthYawPitchPose dataset; it does not utilize any data—such as 300W-LP, AFLW200-3D, BIWI, or CMU-Panoptic—that is of extremely low quality.

**Yaw / pitch body alone** (`<run>_kappa_*.onnx`, `hfhpe_dinov3_yawpitch_*.onnx` for the teacher; no roll, input assumed upright):

**How to read these numbers (important):** the models are trained with `--unified` (train + validation merged on purpose), so the yaw/pitch values above measure how well each model fits the training distribution and **must not be compared with published benchmark results**. They are selection metrics, useful for comparing the rows against each other. The yaw/pitch columns are the same in both tables because the roll branch does not change the body; the integrated table adds the roll estimate, the derotation and their cost. The roll column is the roll branch — a YawNet w1.0 (0.77M) distilled online from a DINOv3 ViT-L/16 roll teacher trained at 320×320, run at 64×64 for the 64 px students and at 128×128 for hfhpe_dinov3 and the 128 px hfhpe_vitt / hfhpe_hgnetv2 / hfhpe_yawnet — evaluated on **wedge-free canvas rotations** of the validation crops, an honest protocol in which the four corners are filled with real context pixels instead of border replication.

## 2. Features

- **SynthYawPitchPose dataset tooling**: JSONL label format (`data/yawpitchpose/{train,val}.jsonl` + 320px whole-head crops) covering seven synthetic generation sources, full-surround yaw, pitch −120…+120°, and large-accessory occlusion (masks, sunglasses, hats). Includes the audit tooling used to review every label by eye and correct 34.8k of them (mirror fixes, high-pitch frontal audit, per-cell visual sheets).
- **Angle regression that cannot wrap around**: every angle is a biternion (unit `cos/sin`) trained with a von Mises NLL; a κ head per angle outputs the concentration = confidence. No discontinuity at 0/360° and no gimbal handling in the loss.
- **Online teacher → student distillation** (`scripts/distill_yawnet.py`): the teacher (DINOv3 ViT-L/16 @320) is run on the fly on the same crops as the student (KD 0.7 / GT 0.3), with WSD learning-rate schedule, EMA, inverse-frequency yaw balancing and warm-start (`--init-student`) between generations.
- **Roll branch with label-free real-image adaptation** (`scripts/train_hfhpe_roll.py`): roll GT is the exact synthetic rotation θ applied at load time, so any upright crop is a training sample. Real photographs are re-cropped with the same DEIMv2 detector as deployment and mixed in via `--extra-data` — their pose labels are never used as targets. This removed the catastrophic ~180° roll failures on real photos. Supports ViT-T (`--arch vitt`) and DINOv3 ViT-L/16 (`--arch vitl`, 320 px) roll teachers, online KD (`--teacher`; with a higher-resolution teacher the student receives an area-downscaled copy of the same augmented view) and warm-start (`--init-student`). The deployed branch is a YawNet w1.0 distilled from the ViT-L teacher.
- **Wedge-free canvas rotation** (`scripts/build_roll_canvas_synth.py` + the `canvas` field of `roll_dataset.py`): rotating a square crop normally leaves border-replication wedges in the corners whose orientation leaks the applied angle (a shortcut the model learns to read). The canvas build stores a 1.8× context canvas around the identical crop contract; at train time the central contract region is rotated onto the full output while the corners are filled from the real surrounding ring. θ=0 reproduces the deployed crop exactly, so the runtime contract is unchanged.
- **One-pass HFHPE composition** (`scripts/export_hfhpe.py`): roll estimate → GridSample derotation → normalization conversion → yaw/pitch body, fused into a single ONNX graph.
- **κ-gated derotation (optional)** (`--roll-gate sigmoid|relu`): when the roll confidence κ_roll falls below a threshold τ, the in-graph derotation is blended toward the identity rotation, preventing a wrong large-angle derotation from corrupting the yaw/pitch body. Built from Sub/Mul/Sigmoid/Relu/Clip/Sqrt only — no Where/Greater/Cast — for edge-runtime compatibility. The `cos_sin` / `kappa` outputs always stay the raw estimates.
- **Verified ONNX export** (`scripts/export_onnx.py`): onnxslim → onnxsim → graph canonicalization → torch/onnxruntime parity → fixed batch-1 → N-batch conversion with batch 1/2/3 agreement checks → machine audit → I/O-contract metadata injection (readable in Netron).
- **Preview instruments**: 3×3 validation preview sheets (yaw ring + pitch dial) and 3-axis overlay previews for the integrated ONNX model.

## 3. Models and the ONNX I/O contract

| | Teacher dinov3-320 | Student vitt-064 | Student hgnetv2-064 | Student yawnet-064 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backbone | DINOv3 ViT-L/16 (weights not vendored) | ViT-T/16 (own implementation, initialized from `ckpts/vitt_distill.pt`) | PP-HGNetV2-B0, final stage stride-1 (own implementation, initialized from `ckpts/PPHGNetV2_B0_stage1.pth`) | MBConv CNN (own implementation, from scratch) |
| Head | 6 outputs: yaw/pitch biternion + κ each | same | same | same |
| Input normalization | ImageNet mean/std | center05 `x/127.5 − 1` | center05 | center05 |
| Roll branch | YawNet w1.0, 0.77M params, center05, distilled from a DINOv3 ViT-L/16 roll teacher (320×320); run at 128×128 for hfhpe_dinov3 and the 128 px vitt / hgnetv2 / yawnet, and at 64×64 for the 64 px students (the body input is resized to the roll size inside the graph) | | | |

Integrated HFHPE ONNX (`hfhpe_*.onnx`; the yaw/pitch-only exports `*_1x3xSxS.onnx` / `*_kappa_*.onnx` omit the roll fields). The `hfhpe_*_rollgate_*.onnx` variants embed the κ-gated derotation (sigmoid gate; τ=20 for the three students, τ=95 for hfhpe_dinov3 and the 128 px hfhpe_vitt / hfhpe_hgnetv2 / hfhpe_yawnet: with the 128×128 roll branch κ_roll saturates on almost every real image, so any non-saturated value signals an unreliable roll estimate) with the exact same I/O contract; the gate settings are also recorded in the ONNX metadata (`roll_gate`):

```
# RGB, center05 normalization x/127.5 - 1 (also for the dinov3 variant:
# the ImageNet conversion happens inside the graph). S = 64 (students) / 320 (dinov3)
input   images   float32 [N, 3, S, S]
# unit-vector pairs; angle_deg = degrees(atan2(sin, cos))
output  cos_sin  float32 [N, 6]   # [cos_yaw, sin_yaw, cos_pitch, sin_pitch, cos_roll, sin_roll]
# von Mises concentration = confidence per angle (~1e-3 ... 100)
output  kappa    float32 [N, 3]   # [kappa_yaw, kappa_pitch, kappa_roll]
```

Angle convention (also written into every ONNX file as metadata):

- **yaw**: 0° = facing the camera, +90° = turned to the viewer's left, 180° = back of the head, 270° = viewer's right (mod 360).
- **pitch**: positive = looking up, negative = seen from above; range about −120…+120°, values beyond +90° describe the back-tilt band.
- **roll**: positive = image counter-clockwise (top of the head moves toward the viewer's left), full 360°.

Crop contract (identical in training, evaluation and deployment): DEIMv2-Wholebody49 head box (class 7; score ≥ 0.30 when building the training and evaluation crops, ≥ 0.70 by default in the demo) → expand each side by 5% → square of the longer side, clamped at the image border → resize to S×S. Two files are written per export: fixed batch-1 `*_1x3xSxS.onnx` and `*_Nx3xSxS.onnx` with a symbolic batch axis, verified to agree at batch 1/2/3.

## 4. Setup

Prerequisites: Linux, Python 3.13 (pinned in `.python-version`), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and an NVIDIA GPU (torch built for CUDA 12.8; an 8 GB GPU is enough for inference and export, full training targets a 96 GB class GPU). Dependencies are pinned with `==` in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PINTO0309/High-Angle_Robust_Fast_Head_Pose_Estimation.git
cd High-Angle_Robust_Fast_Head_Pose_Estimation
uv sync --frozen                                   # default: onnxruntime-gpu 1.22.0 (the validated toolchain)
uv sync --frozen --no-group ort --group tensorrt   # alternative: onnxruntime-gpu 1.26.0 (TensorRT EP, BF16)
# NOTE: a plain `uv run` re-syncs the DEFAULT groups; keep the same group flags on `uv run`
# or use `uv run --no-sync` after the manual sync.
```

### 4.2 Data (`data/`, not bundled)

- `data/yawpitchpose/` — the SynthYawPitchPose dataset: `labels_fixed.jsonl` / `train.jsonl` / `val.jsonl` plus 320px whole-head crops under `images/`. Seven synthetic generation sources plus 618 self-portrait crops of the author (`synthetic_real_001`, teacher pseudo-labels corrected by hand), not redistributed.
- Roll-adaptation crops (optional, `--extra-data` of the roll training): any directory of upright whole-head crops with a `manifest.jsonl` (`{"image": "images/<name>.jpg", ...}` per line). Real photo collections can be converted with the preprocessing tooling in `scripts/`; their pose labels are never used as training targets.

Training logs are written to `runs/<run>/train_log.jsonl` (validation metrics per epoch); the best checkpoint is `runs/<run>/best_<val>.pt` and the resume checkpoint is `last.pt` (`--resume`).

Both checkpoints also store the full argument list (dataset roots, teacher / initial-weight paths, hyperparameters) and, for distilled students, the teacher's path and metrics. Before sharing a checkpoint, run `scripts/sanitize_checkpoint.py runs/<run>` to write a copy under `runs/public/<run>/` that keeps only the weights and the keys the loaders need; `export_onnx.py --ckpt runs/public/<run>` then produces identically named ONNX files.

## 6. ONNX demo

Two-stage inference demo (adapted from the [HRFFA](https://github.com/PINTO0309/High-Angle_Robust_Fast_FaceAlignment) demo; no face alignment or YawNet stage): DEIMv2-Wholebody49 head detection → integrated HFHPE ONNX on every head crop. It draws the head boxes, a 3-axis pose overlay per head (X = red right cheek, Y = green chin, Z = blue nose), the per-head yaw/pitch/roll text, and a top-right yaw ring for the largest head (0 = facing the camera, 90 = viewer's left).

```bash
# images
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -i images_dir -o output_dir
# video file / camera 0
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -v input.mp4 -o output_dir
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -v 0 -o output_dir
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -pm models/hfhpe_vitt_1x3x64x64.onnx -v 0 -o output_dir --head_score_threshold 0.35
# TensorRT EP (engine cache under models/trt_cache)
uv run --no-group ort --group tensorrt python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -v 0 -o output_dir -d tensorrt --head_score_threshold 0.70
# swap the pose model
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -pm models/hfhpe_hgnetv2_Nx3x64x64.onnx -v 0 -o output_dir
# N-batch graph of the default model (all heads of a frame in one pass)
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -pm models/hfhpe_vitt_rollgate_Nx3x64x64.onnx -v 0 -o output_dir
# without the kappa gate (same I/O; always derotates by the estimated roll)
uv run python demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py -pm models/hfhpe_vitt_Nx3x64x64.onnx -v 0 -o output_dir
```

Defaults: detector `models/deimv2_dinov3_s_wholebody49_boxes_only.onnx`, pose `models/hfhpe_vitt_rollgate_1x3x64x64.onnx` (the κ-gated ViT-T model, fixed batch-1 graph: heads are processed one by one; N-batch graphs are also accepted and run all heads of a frame in one pass). The crop contract of section 3 (5% per-side expansion, long-side square clamped at the border, resize to S×S) is applied as-is to every head with score ≥ 0.70 (`--head_score_threshold`). Input normalization is detected per model: the pose model from its ONNX metadata (center05, or ImageNet for the dinov3 yaw/pitch-only graph), the detector from its graph (ImageNet mean/std for DINOv3-based detectors, plain /255 for HGNetV2-based ones; `--detector_norm div255|imagenet` overrides it — the training crops were built with `div255`). Keys on video / camera input: ESC = quit, `b` = head boxes, `a` = 3-axis overlay, `t` = angle text, `r` = yaw ring. `--save_raw_predictions` writes one JSON per image / frame (bbox, score, yaw/pitch/roll, κ); `--yaw_smooth_tau 0.15` smooths the ring display with a circular EMA (display only).

**6DRepNet360** — reference head-pose model used by the dataset audit tooling, not by the deployed graphs (code MIT; weights not bundled). The yaw convention of SynthYawPitchPose (0° = facing the camera, +90° = viewer's left) follows its output convention, and its ONNX export (`models/sixdrepnet360_1x3x224x224_full.onnx`, PINTO_model_zoo #423) was used to check the sign of the synthetic yaw labels (`verify_labels_sixd.py`, `fix_labels.py`) and to measure the camera-yaw augmentation coefficient (`verify_cam_yaw_sign.py`).

HFHPE reuses its single-warp geometric augmentation design (`augment.py`), its export procedure (simplify → parity → N-batch → audit) and its two-stage ONNX demo as the base of `demo/demo_hfhpe_onnx.py`; the HRFFA ViT-L 68-landmark model (`hrffa_vitl_ibug68`) also served as a second reference for the sign of large-yaw labels during dataset auditing (`study_landmark_yaw.py`, `fix_labels.py`).
